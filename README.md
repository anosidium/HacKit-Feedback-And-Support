Requires macOS Big Sur or later and natively supports Apple Silicon Mac computers.

# TestFlight

HacKit 3.0 is in development and is available on [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/lJyZPVGl). It requires macOS Monterey or later.

# Synopsis

HacKit is a portmanteau of Hacker News and `AppKit` which means it is a `Cocoa` app and made exactly for the Mac. It is not a `Catalyst` app nor is it a port of an iPhone nor an iPad app. It is a Mac first app.

It is a reader for <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a>, so that means you can read stories, comments and view polls from the website and can also search stories and polls.

The app was developed by a British macOS and iOS developer during the Coronavirus pandemic. He started it in 2020. The first iteration of HacKit was developed for `macOS Catalina` and went through a number of iterations and then rebuilt completely from scratch for `macOS Big Sur`.
