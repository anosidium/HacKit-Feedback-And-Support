# HacKit — hækɪt

![A screenshot of HacKit](A Screenshot of HacKit.png)

A portmanteau of Hacker News and AppKit, because it is a Cocoa app. It is a Mac first app. It is not a Catalyst or a port of an iPhone or iPad app.

It is a reader for Hacker News, so that means you can read stories and comments from the website and can search stories.

HacKit was built alone by a British macOS and iOS developer during the Coronavirus pandemic. Yes, he is looking for a macOS or iOS developer job. Please consider hiring him.
